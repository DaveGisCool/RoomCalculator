# RoomCalculator
This lab 1 for GrandCircus
This meets the requirements of the assignment:
Task: Calculate the perimeter and area of various classrooms at Grand Circus.
What will the application do?
● The application prompts the user to enter values for the length and width of a classroom.
● The application displays the area and perimeter of that classroom.
● The application classifies the room as small (up to 250 square feet), medium (more than 250 but less than 650 square feet, or large (650 square feet or more.
***Loops were not covered. This is optional: ● The application prompts the user to continue (keep measuring rooms!).
Build Specifications
1. Assume that the rooms are perfect rectangles.
2. Assume that the user will enter valid numeric data for length and width.
3. The application should accept decimal entries.
Hints:
● Make sure you use the right formulas for area and perimeter.
● The Snug is 24’ 6” x 20’ 0”. The Penthouse is 42’ 6” x 16’ 6”.
Extra Challenges:
***Loops were not covered. This is optional: ● The application should continue only if the user agrees to.
● Calculate the volume of the rooms. (Ask the user for the height as well, or assume a height of 10’.)
